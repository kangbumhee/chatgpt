# ChatGPT Block Stacker Game

This repository contains a simple block stacking game. You can play it in the terminal or in a web browser.

## Terminal Version

Run the game with Python 3:

```bash
python3 block_stacker.py
```

Choose a column number to drop a block into that column. The block will fall until it hits another block or the bottom of the board. Try to stack as many blocks as possible before the board fills up. Press `q` at any prompt to quit the game.

## HTML Version

Open `block_stacker.html` in any modern browser. Click on a column to drop a block. When the board is full, the game will end.
