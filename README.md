# ChatGPT Block Stacker Game

This repository contains a simple text-based block stacking game written in Python.

## How to Play

Run the game with Python 3:

```bash
python3 block_stacker.py
```

Choose a column number to drop a block into that column. The block will fall until it hits another block or the bottom of the board. Try to stack as many blocks as possible before the board fills up. Press `q` at any prompt to quit the game.
